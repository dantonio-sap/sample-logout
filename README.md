# sample-logout
This sample shows an example of how to perform a logout using approuter and a fiori ui.  It is designed to be deployed using the managed approuter, but does not require the launchpad service to operate.

To try it out, clone to Business App Studio, build the MTAR file (right click on the mta.yaml) and deploy it.
